# personal-cv
To be frank, crafting a CV during such a steep career change is no simple task. 

I decided to include my music activities as well, as I see profound similarities between programming and music: both are creative, iterative, and demand a significant investment of time and effort to master.

This repository serves a dual purpose:
1. As a CV – showcasing my professional journey and skills.
2. As a portfolio – demonstrating what I’ve learned so far in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Built using Bootstrap and enhanced with custom CSS, this project reflects my attention to detail and passion for creating clean, functional, and visually appealing designs.
