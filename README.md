To be frank, crafting a CV during such a steep career change is challenging to shape. I decided to include my music activities as well, as I see significant similarities between programming and music. 
Both are creative, iterative, and require a vast amount of time and effort to master.

This repository serves both as a CV and as a showcase of what Iâ€™ve learned so far in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques.

Created with Bootstrap and a bit of custom CSS code.
